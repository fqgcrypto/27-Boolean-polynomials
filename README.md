# We use this file calculate_polynomial_equal_0_experiment_27 polynomial equations_copy1_20240102.py to calculate the probability that the nonlinear terms in the 27 Boolean polynomials are both equal to 0. 
The nonlinear terms of each polynomial can be found in the code.
Each complete Boolean polynomial can be constructed as follows.
For example, 
y1=x1+nonlinear terms2,
y2=x2+nonlinear terms2,
...
y27=x27+nonlinear terms27.
Please refer to our paper and code for more details.
